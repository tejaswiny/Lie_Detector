Project Working:Our skin is amazing! It provides a medium for us to experience the sense of touch, it keeps infections out and keeps innards in but I bet you didn't know that our skin changes conductivity depending on many different things one being our mood! It called Electrodermal activity (EDA). The basics are that our skin changes its conductivity depending on how we feel.

We start by connecting our Arduino to the subject and then connect the Arduino to a computer (Arduino IDE).

Firstly, we will open the serial plotter in the arduino ide , to see a plotter come up with a straight horizontal line.
Now we have to start by asking the subject some easy questions that can be answered in simple "YES" or "NO" and that we know they will answer truthfully like "Is your name xyz?" and "Do you live in abc?" to get a baseline and from there we can start asking questions that they may lie about, if they do they would probably feel nervous and then we can read the change in the base line that be established earlier if they lie.

About the code: The Arduino is a program build system that in addition to C and C++ files will wrap a partial C++ source file to help us out. The partial source file is given an .ino extension. The Arduino build system also includes many libraries useful for programming the hardware that is was originally designed to support.
The .ino file is included in a generated file that includes some headers and a main() that calls the setup() and loop() functions.
